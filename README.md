# Hey there 👋

I'm **Grey**, a freelance tech enthusiast who loves exploring and is always open to new experiences. I'm easy-going and enjoy connecting with others.

- 🏘️ I'm always at home, and most of the time, I'm in front of my computer.
- 🛥️ Whenever I see others' profiles saying **"love to travel,"** 🏕️ I always feel a bit guilty.
- 🧑‍💻 I don't dislike traveling; I just find coding more appealing. Yes, it may imply unhealthy habits. So, I found an outdoor activity for myself, which is **fishing** 🎣.
- 🎣 I love fishing, and whenever I'm outdoors, I'm always on the lookout for a good fishing spot.
- 🧠 I'm an independent thinker and have my own opinions on many things, even in China.
- 👨‍💻 I'm a Java backend technology programmer, and I'm also a big data-related developer.
